/*! Open Historia — shared save-library lock © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// Two desktop builds, ONE save library.
//
// The fork's beta installs alongside the official app and deliberately shares its
// saves, scenarios and settings (see USER_ROOT in main.cjs), so a player can play a
// campaign in the beta and carry on in the stable app. The cost of that is that the
// two must never write it at once: both run an embedded server over the same JSON
// files, and the loser of a race silently loses a turn.
//
// Electron's own requestSingleInstanceLock is keyed on the app's userData, which is
// exactly what the beta renames apart — so it cannot see the other install at all.
// Hence this file lock.
//
// Lives here rather than inline in main.cjs so it can be tested: main.cjs requires
// electron and cannot be loaded by `node --test`. `ask` is injected for the same
// reason — main.cjs passes the real dialog.

//
// A lock file whose process is gone is not a holder: a crash or a force-kill never
// runs the release, and refusing to start after one would be worse than the race
// this guards against.

    // quit while that build was still running, so the next launch got no warning at
    // all with two copies still sharing one library. The record names whoever
    // claimed it first, which is exactly who a third launch needs to be told about.
