/*! Open Historia — downloads the large world-map assets from the GitHub Release © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// The big map binaries (pmtiles, geojson, city seeds) used to live in Git LFS.
// GitHub's free LFS *bandwidth* is only 1 GB/month shared across the whole org,
// and a full checkout pulls ~200 MB — so a handful of installs exhausted it and
// every download then 403'd. Release-asset bandwidth is free and unmetered, so
// these files now ship as assets on a GitHub Release instead (see scripts/
// map-assets.json). This script makes the local tree match that manifest:
// anything missing or the wrong content is downloaded from the release and
// checksum-verified. The launcher and the updater both call it in place of
// `git lfs pull` / the old LFS media-host fetch.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/fetch-map-assets.mjs            # verify sha256, re-fetch anything that differs
//   node scripts/fetch-map-assets.mjs --ensure   # faster: only fetch files that are missing / wrong size
//
// Best-effort: it never exits non-zero, so it can never block a launch or an
// update. On any problem it warns and leaves the existing file in place.
