// Shared unit interaction state + the mutations the player owns.
//
// There are TWO unit systems here, chosen by the betaUnits setting and pinned for
// the session (see runtime/mapSettings.js isBetaUnits). Everything above the
// mode-specific mutations — the poll, the in-memory list, the pub/sub, deploy —
// is shared, and both systems read and write the same save shape, so a save can
// move between them without losing anything.
//
// CLASSIC (default, and what upstream ships): a wargame the player plays. Move
// and attack write immediately AND queue a machine-readable order so the AI
// honors or contests them on the next time-jump. Combat uses the seeded resolver
// in unitCombat.js for instant feedback; the AI reconciles fronts on the jump.
// See moveUnitTo / attackWith / attackFeature.
//
// BETA (work in progress): units are a VISUAL REPRESENTATION of what the events
// say, not a wargame. No manual movement and no manual combat — the AI owns where
// forces go and what happens when they meet, and the engine
// (runtime/unitMotion.js) advances standing orders realistically every turn. What
// the player keeps is stating intent: placing a formation, and asking for orders
// in words. See requestUnitOrders.
//
// Holds the current unit list in memory (refreshed from world.json every 5s so
// AI-spawned/moved units appear) and applies the player's own mutations
// immediately for snappy feedback, persisting them to world.json. A tiny pub/sub
// lets the map layer, the selection popup and the Forces panel re-render.
