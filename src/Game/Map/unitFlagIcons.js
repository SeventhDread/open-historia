/*! Open Historia — unit counter flag icons © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// Turns a unit's owner into a round flag icon sitting inside its counter.
//
// MapLibre can only draw an icon that is already in the style's image atlas, so
// every flag has to be fetched, rasterised and handed to map.addImage() before a
// symbol layer can name it. That makes three things matter:
//
//   * A flag is fetched ONCE per owner and the decoded pixels are kept. Owners
//     repeat across dozens of counters, and the same handful recur every time the
//     unit list is re-synced (every 5s).
//   * map.setStyle() throws the whole image atlas away — a basemap change or a
//     projection toggle silently drops every flag. So "is this on the map?" is
//     asked of the map itself on every sync, and a dropped icon is re-added from
//     the cached pixels without a second network request.
//   * A failure is cached too. A scenario country that resolves to no ISO flag
//     would otherwise re-request on every sync, forever.

// rather than blurring at close zoom.
