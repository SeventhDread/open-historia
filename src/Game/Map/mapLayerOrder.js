/*! Open Historia — map layer stacking order © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// The one place that decides what sits above what on the game map.
//
// Nothing that adds a layer to this map passes a beforeId: <Nations>, <Cities>,
// <MarkersLayer> and <Units> all call addLayer() with no anchor, so MapLibre
// appends each one wherever the stack happens to be at that moment. That order
// is NOT stable, because two of those components add layers late:
//
//   * <Cities> returns null on a custom-cities scenario until cities.geojson
//     arrives, then mounts a whole new cities-source — so the city markers and
//     labels are appended ABOVE the unit counters that mounted while it was gone.
//   * regions-disputed only mounts once a disputed region with stripes exists,
//     which needs world state. It is a `fill`, so it lands above the labels AND
//     above the units, painting its stripes over both.
//
// Beyond the obvious overdraw, the stacking order decides the frame rate. With
// 3D terrain on, MapLibre "drapes" a contiguous run of drapeable layers into a
// per-tile texture and flushes that stack on the first layer it cannot drape.
// Every extra stack costs the whole drape cache, not just an extra pass:
// RenderPool.freeAllObjects() runs at the end of every flush, so the next stack
// is handed the previous stack's textures and re-stamps them, and next frame the
// stamps no longer match. A single stray fill or line layer above the labels is
// enough to make every fill and hairline on the map — match-expression
// fill-colour and all — re-render per tile, per frame.
//
// So the order below is canonical, and enforceMapLayerOrder puts the stack back
// into it after every style change.

// Layer types MapLibre can drape onto 3D terrain. Anything else (symbol, circle,
// heatmap, fill-extrusion, custom) is drawn live, in 3D, and ends a drape run.

// Bottom to top. Only layers this app adds from React appear here — the basemap
// layers baked into buildWorldStyle (satellite, hills, custom-bg-*) are owned by
// the style, always sit at the bottom, and are deliberately left alone.
//
// A NEW LAYER MUST BE ADDED TO THIS LIST. Anything missing from it is never
// moved, so it ends up beneath everything listed here once the first arrangement
// runs — which for a symbol layer means buried under the region fills.
//
// Two placements are load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
//   * units-heading / units-station sit at the END of the draped run, below the
//     label symbols instead of after them. They are `line` layers, so putting
//     them after the labels opens a second drape stack and costs the cache (see
//     above). Below the labels they extend the one run that starts at the
//     basemap raster. The visible cost is that a heading line passes under a
//     city or country label, which is ordinary cartography.
//   * The three counter layers close the list. A unit must never be painted
//     over: the glyph and strength label carry dark halos and stay legible
//     through a translucent fill, but the disc is its owner's colour sitting
//     under that same owner's colour, so it washes out to a ghost.
