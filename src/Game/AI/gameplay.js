const ACTIONS_REFERENCE = "[Actions You Can Take]\nThis is the full menu of levers you have to change the world. Everything you change rides on an event's \"impacts\" object, except the two whole-jump levers noted at the end. Reach for the RIGHT lever, and NEVER narrate a change in an event's text without also emitting the impact that makes it real — narration and world state must always agree.\n\n• regionTransfers — Move a region to a new owner. This is the most important lever and the one most often forgotten: use it for every conquest, cession, sale, liberation, annexation, or hand-over, one entry per region. Shape: {\"regionId\":\"<exact id, or the plain region name if you don't know the id>\",\"regionName\":\"\",\"fromCode\":\"\",\"toCode\":\"<new owner code>\"}. An event whose text says land changed hands but that carries no regionTransfers is invalid output and silently breaks the map. Transfer in order of proximity to the attacker's territory; never hand over an isolated region ringed by enemy land without a naval or airborne reason. A transfer is enacted IMMEDIATELY when the other side has agreed (a treaty, a negotiated cession, an event where they conceded) or when the ground has already been taken and held - a hand-over both sides accept needs no programme and no project. Where neither is true the land has NOT changed hands: record the claim with regionClaims instead and leave the border exactly where it is.\n\n• polityChanges — Create, rename, recolor, or re-describe a polity. One entry can do any combination: {\"code\":\"<polity code>\",\"name\":\"<new name, only if it changed>\",\"color\":\"#RRGGBB (only if it changed)\",\"aliases\":[\"...\"],\"reputation\":0-100,\"intelligence\":0-100,\"tags\":[\"...\"],\"stats\":{...},\"note\":\"<why>\"}. Create a polity by giving a new code with a name and color. Change name/color when the polity's identity actually changes - a regime change, a revolution, a unification or partition, a proclaimed republic or a restored monarchy - and ALWAYS when the player has ordered it for their own polity. A mere new leader is not a rename. But a rename or recolour the player has ordered for THEIR OWN country is an administrative act of their own government: it needs no other power's consent, it cannot be refused, and it must be enacted in this jump by an event carrying polityChanges with the new name and that action's id in actionIds. Keep \"code\" as the polity's CURRENT name - the engine matches on it and then stores the new one; a change addressed to the name you are introducing lands on nothing and mints a second country beside the real one. On an ideological or alignment shift, rewrite the COMPLETE tags list (it is a full replacement, not a delta). Set reputation (0 = pariah, 100 = universally trusted) only when this turn's events actually moved a polity's standing. Set intelligence (0 = no service to speak of, 100 = the best in the world) only when something changed it: a purge or defection, a new bureau or budget, a foreign spy ring exposed, a player action that built the service up or ran it down. A SUDDEN shock — a purge, a defector, a ring rolled up — is a direct change here and takes effect at once. Building a service UP is not sudden and does not belong here: open it on the Projects board as a programme and put the new rating in that project's onComplete.polityChanges, so it arrives when the work actually finishes and the player can watch it coming, fund it, or have a rival wreck it first. Deciding to have a better service is not the same as having one. A country's national statistics move ONLY through \"stats\" here — send just the fields that changed; everything omitted keeps its prior value. That includes WHO LEADS: when a leader is overthrown, assassinated, dies, resigns or is voted out, put the successor's name in stats.leader (together with stats.government and stats.stability when those moved too). An event that narrates a leader falling but leaves stats.leader untouched leaves the OLD name standing on that country's stat sheet, so the story and the sheet disagree.\n\n• regionClaims — Mark territory CLAIMED but not held, so the map can show a dispute instead of pretending nothing happened. Use it when a polity asserts a right to land it does not control and has not been given: an irredentist declaration, a proclaimed union, a contested border, a government-in-exile's title, a player declaring a neighbour's province theirs. Shape: {\"regionId\":\"<exact id, or the plain region name>\",\"claimantCode\":\"<claiming polity's full name>\",\"note\":\"<why>\"}; add \"drop\":true to withdraw a claim that was renounced, traded away, or lost with the claimant's defeat. The region renders striped in every claimant's colour and stays that way until it is settled - by a regionTransfers entry when someone finally wins or concedes it, or by a drop. NEVER move a border for a claim alone, and never leave a claim unrecorded either: a declaration that changes nothing the player can see is a declaration they cannot tell they made.\n\n• unitOps — Move the war on the map with battalions. Four ops:\n    {\"op\":\"spawn\",\"unit\":{\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"infantry|armor|air|naval|artillery|garrison\",\"ownerCode\":\"\",\"strength\":1-1000,\"lng\":0,\"lat\":0,\"regionId\":\"\"}}\n    {\"op\":\"move\",\"unitId\":\"<existing id>\",\"toLng\":0,\"toLat\":0,\"regionId\":\"\",\"note\":\"\"}\n    {\"op\":\"strength\",\"unitId\":\"<existing id>\",\"strength\":0-1000,\"note\":\"\"}\n    {\"op\":\"remove\",\"unitId\":\"<existing id>\",\"note\":\"\"}\n  Spawn units for mobilizations and reinforcements, move them to reflect offensives, lower their strength as they take losses, and remove them only when destroyed or disbanded. Only reference unit ids that appear in the current-units list. When a front is decisively won, pair the advance with a regionTransfers entry so the border follows the troops.\n\n• markerOps — Place, remove, rename or resize a named structure or city. Four ops:\n    {\"op\":\"build\",\"marker\":{\"name\":\"\",\"kind\":\"<lowercase, e.g. military base / port / embassy / airfield / city>\",\"ownerCode\":\"\",\"lng\":0,\"lat\":0,\"note\":\"\",\"foundedAt\":\"\"}}\n    {\"op\":\"remove\",\"name\":\"<exact existing name>\",\"note\":\"\"}\n    {\"op\":\"rename\",\"name\":\"<current name>\",\"newName\":\"<new name>\",\"note\":\"<why>\"}\n    {\"op\":\"population\",\"name\":\"<city>\",\"population\":<whole number of people>,\"note\":\"<why>\"}\n  Emit build whenever an event founds or constructs a place, remove when one is destroyed, and rename when a city or structure is renamed (rename works on existing map cities too — a city renamed after a leader or ideology, a capital re-designated, a conquered city given the conqueror's name). Structures NEVER move borders: a facility one polity builds inside another's land does not transfer the region, and ownerCode is who runs the facility, not who owns the ground. Emit population whenever an event plausibly moves how many people live somewhere - a siege, famine, epidemic, bombing or evacuation shrinking a city; an industrial boom, resettlement or refugee influx growing one - giving the new TOTAL, not the change. It works on any city on the map, whether the scenario authored it or it came with the world.\n\n• createdChats — Have another polity open a diplomatic chat with the player BECAUSE of this event (a war scare prompting mediation, a border incident prompting an ultimatum, a windfall prompting a trade delegation). Shape: {\"countries\":[\"...\"],\"title\":\"<names the purpose>\",\"speaker\":\"<the initiating polity — never the player>\",\"openingMessage\":\"<that leader's first message, in their voice>\"}. The other side always speaks first; a blank or untitled chat is invalid.\n\n• actionIds — List the ids of the player's queued actions that this event resolves, so the game can clear them from the queue.\n\nWhole-jump levers (top level of your output, NOT inside an event):\n• diplomaticOutreach — Polities reaching out to the player on their OWN initiative this period — treaty feelers, trade proposals, non-aggression pacts, mediation offers, warnings, summit invitations — not tied to any single event. Same shape as createdChats. Open one whenever a polity plausibly would, rather than defaulting to none.\n• catalyst — An interactive branching scene handed to the player when a moment genuinely demands their decision, or null when none is warranted. Shape: {\"title\":\"\",\"premise\":\"\",\"opening\":\"\",\"choices\":[\"...\", \"...\", up to 5 distinct]}.\n\nKeep the total across createdChats and diplomaticOutreach to at most 3 per jump, and only when the approach genuinely serves the sender's interests.";

To capture ONLY a city while its region stays with its current owner (a besieged holdout, an occupied port, an enclave), do NOT name it in regionTransfers; instead emit an impacts.markerOps build for it — {\"op\":\"build\",\"marker\":{\"name\":\"<city>\",\"kind\":\"city\",\"ownerCode\":\"<new holder>\",\"lng\":<lng>,\"lat\":<lat>}} — using that city\u2019s coordinates from [City Coordinates].

Reach for them readily: a mobilization, a build-up on a border, a fleet sailing, an offensive, a withdrawal all deserve to be visible. But keep the map legible - only formations that matter to the story. A great power at war might show five or six; a country at peace shows one or two, or none.\nstrength is a PERCENTAGE of established strength (100 = fresh and full, 60 = worn down, 20 = a shell), and composition says what the formation actually is ("1 aircraft carrier, 2 frigates", "3 tank regiments"). Write both, plus a one-sentence note on what it is doing and where. A counter that does not say what it is tells the player nothing.\nDo not teleport. A move may only cover what that unit could really travel between the previous event's date and this one's. The engine enforces this: an over-long move becomes a partial advance that continues automatically on later turns, so ordering the full distance is safe and correct.\nThe map is what ${playerName} KNOWS, not omniscience. A force may legitimately appear far from its own territory when it is being DETECTED rather than arriving - a submarine that has shadowed a fleet for weeks, infiltrators already in country, a deployment only now confirmed. Such a unit is drawn as unconfirmed, which is correct and not a penalty. The one thing you cannot conjure is a fixed installation: use markerOps build for a base, and never spawn a far-flung garrison.\nSet posture whenever you place or move a unit - holding, massing, patrol, transit, exercise, blockade, withdrawing, assaulting. It is how the player reads intent off the map. "patrol" is special: the engine keeps a patrolling unit working its station on its own, turn after turn, so state it once and leave it.\n\"assaulting\" is the other special one: a formation that ARRIVES under it is marked engaged, in contact at the objective, instead of idle. Use it when an event has a force actually storming a province rather than massing near it — including when the player has ordered an assault in words (\"Attack Provence\"), which is how they commit troops to a province, since they cannot move their own formations. You still own the OUTCOME: resolve the fighting on a later turn with casualties, and a regionTransfer only if the province genuinely falls.

[Sovereign Acts and What Needs Consent]
Before you decide how long one of ${playerName}'s orders takes, ask one question: does this act need anyone else's agreement?

NO - IT IS INTERNAL. Their own name, colour, flag, style, title, anthem, official language, capital designation, ministry structure, proclamations, and the administration of territory they already hold. Their own government decides and nobody may refuse. THESE RESOLVE IN THIS JUMP. Enact each with a single event dated inside the covered period, carrying the impact that makes it real - polityChanges for a change of name, colour, style or tags; markerOps rename for a renamed city or capital - and list that action's id in actionIds. They cannot fail for lack of consent, they need no programme, budget or timetable, and they never take multiple rounds. Narrate the reaction if it is interesting - a rival's contempt, a domestic celebration, the old name lingering in foreign newspapers - but the act itself is DONE. Never open a Projects entry for one, and never report one as in progress.

YES - IT TOUCHES ANOTHER POLITY. Region transfers, cessions, annexations, border adjustments: anything that moves land or binds another government. These need one of two things first, and it must actually be in the campaign record: CONSENT (that polity agreed, in a diplomatic exchange, a treaty, or an event where they conceded) or a FAIT ACCOMPLI (the ground has already been taken and held, so they have no say left - the map and the units are the evidence). Where either is already true, enact it THIS JUMP with regionTransfers; a hand-over both sides accept needs no programme either.

Where NEITHER is true yet, the order is not refused and not quietly deferred - it splits in two, and BOTH halves happen now. First, record the claim with regionClaims, so the region shows as disputed on the map immediately and the player can see that their declaration landed. Second, say plainly what is missing - whose agreement, or what has to be taken - and open the project for the campaign that will obtain it, with the transfer itself on that project's onComplete so the border moves the moment the effort actually succeeds. A declaration that changes nothing the player can see is the failure this rule exists to prevent.`;

  // Only the game master still moves the board inline. The jump handed it to the
  // separate `projects` task (generateProjectOps), whose whole prompt is the

Copy the id and name EXACTLY as they appear below - an op that names something not on the board is dropped. When an event STARTS a new multi-round effort (a power lays down a programme, opens a construction project, mounts an operation), open it with op create, including a foreign power's programme the player's services have learned of - set ownerCode to that country's full name.\nBe proportionate. A programme does not move every jump, and inventing progress is worse than reporting none: if nothing happened to it this period, leave it alone. A long jump should move the things that plausibly advanced over that span; a six-hour jump almost never moves any of them. Never open a project for an internal act - a rename, a recolour, a flag, a title, a proclamation, a reshuffle - or for a transfer the other side has already agreed to: those are enacted outright by the event that narrates them (see [Sovereign Acts and What Needs Consent]), and a progress bar for one is always wrong.${board}

Whose project it is. Entries marked THEIRS belong to another power; everything else is the player's own. A foreign programme moves because ITS OWNER moved it and the player's services observed as much - never because the player wished it stopped or ordered it stopped. The player has no priority dial and no cancel over another government's work, so an order of theirs is not a reason to touch a foreign entry: if their orders this period were aimed at a rival's programme, what happens is that THEIR OWN counter-effort advances - the sabotage, the embargo, the covert operation, the race to build first - and the rival's entry then moves only insofar as that effort actually bit, narrated as an event with the consequences that follow. Retaliation is the same rule, not an exception to it: a wrecked programme is wrecked by an event that says who did what and at what cost, and if the operation failed then the rival's programme carries right on. Never close, cancel or deprioritise a foreign entry to satisfy an instruction; close it only when the story genuinely ended it, and say what ended it.

The board above carries a \"Needs a decision this jump\" list. It is worked out from the calendar rather than from anyone's memory: these are efforts whose target date has passed, whose milestone slipped, or that nothing has reported on for several rounds. Deal with EVERY entry on it. There are exactly four ways to deal with one, and inventing progress is not among them:
- It advanced: op update with a real progress figure and a lastUpdate saying what actually happened.
- It is stuck: op update with status stalled and a lastUpdate NAMING the blocker - the money, the shortage, the strike, the rival, the weather. \"Progress continues\" is not an answer. A stalled project with a named cause is, and it gives the player something they can act on.
- It reached or missed a checkpoint: op milestone.
- It is over: op complete, cancel or fail, with a note.
A project marked HIGH PRIORITY must not sit on that list two jumps running - the player has said it matters, so it either moves or it stalls for a stated reason. A project marked low priority may be left drifting with a one-line note, and that is a correct answer for it. Everything else is normal: move it when the story plausibly moved it, and say so plainly when it did not. Never raise a progress figure that nothing in this jump's events justifies - a board of quietly inflating percentages is worth less than an honest one full of stalls.`;

  // HOSTILITY IS A STAND-IN. There is no war state in the world yet, so

  //
  // ── For whoever wires real wars in ──────────────────────────────────────
  // This block is the ONLY place hostility is derived; spycraft.js just takes
  // what it is handed. When world state carries wars, replace the two-line
  // heuristic below with the real thing and leave the rest alone:
  //
  //   1. Keep the contract: candidates is [{ polity, hostile }], one entry per
  //      polity that could plant an agent this round. Every polity in the
  //      world should be a candidate — being at peace only lowers the odds.
  //
  //   2. hostile: true for every polity currently AT WAR with the player. Keep
  //      the reputation clause as an OR if you like (a pariah state still spies
  //      on everyone); drop the "spiedOn" tit-for-tat, which only exists because
  //      nothing better was available.
  //
  //   3. If wars carry a scale (skirmish vs total war, or belligerent vs
  //      co-belligerent), pass `hostility` as a 0..1 number instead of the
  //      boolean and read it in spycraft.js foreignDeployChance — the note
  //      there says how. Do NOT change the seeded roll keys (`${polity}:deploy`)
  //      or every existing save replays its next round differently.
  //
  //   4. Consider a target at war EXPELLING rather than turning a caught agent
  //      (spycraft.js resolveEspionage, the turnChance branch): wartime
  //      counter-intelligence tends to make arrests public. That is a design
  //      choice, not a bug fix — leave it if you want double agents in wartime.
  //
  //   5. The simulator's [Espionage] block (spycraft.js espionageBrief) should
  //      say who is at war with whom next to the agent list, so the model can
  //      connect a stolen plan to the front it matters on. That is one line
  //      added to the brief, fed from the same war state.
  //
  // What NOT to touch: detectionChance / suspicionChance are about the two
  // services, not the relationship, and should stay independent of war.
