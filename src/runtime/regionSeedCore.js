// Pure, dependency-free single pass over a scenario's regions FeatureCollection
// that produces everything the map needs: the owner/provenance index for every
// region (tile fills, click resolution, labels), the authored shapes for
// rendering at every zoom, and a COARSE copy of the plain GADM shapes for the
// far tier. The full-resolution geometry is dropped — geojson-vt tiling of 2.6M+
// vertices and O(vertices) passes over it were the multi-second startup freeze.
//
// Runs identically on the main thread (fallback) and inside regionSeedWorker.js.

// ---- the far tier's geometry ----------------------------------------------
// The stock vector tiles are simplified per zoom, and each region is simplified
// independently, so at low zoom neighbouring borders drift apart and the map
// shows sliver gaps between provinces. The far tier hides that by painting the
// same provinces from the scenario's own geometry below z7, crossfading out as
// the tiles fade in (z5.5 -> z6.5 in Nations.jsx).
//
// It cannot use the raw geometry: that is what froze startup. So the shapes are
// coarsened here, in the worker, where the full document already is — and the
// budget is generous because the tier is only ever seen zoomed OUT.
//
// COARSE_TOLERANCE_DEG is the Douglas-Peucker band. The map runs ~0.0155 deg/px
// at z5.5 (where the tier is fully opaque) and ~0.0078 at z6.5 (where it has
// faded to nothing), so 0.01 deg is 0.64px at z5.5 — already under what a screen
// can show. Tightening it further buys nothing visible and costs vertices
// linearly (0.005 doubles them for 0.32px), which is why the flicker fix below
// spends its budget on RINGS instead of on shape.
//
// COARSE_MIN_SPAN_DEG drops whole rings too small to see, and is the knob that
// has to be set against FLICKER rather than against detail. A ring the tier drops
// is still in the stock tiles, so it blinks into existence as they fade in — and
// at the first setting (0.0155, a full pixel at z5.5) that was 93,000 rings
// appearing across the crossfade, which reads as shimmer over any coast or
// archipelago. At a third of a pixel it cannot be seen arriving. The cost of the
// tighter figure is small and almost all of it is structured-clone time out of
// the worker: 602k -> 694k vertices, 18k -> 41k rings, index unchanged at ~130ms,
// clone 127ms -> 164ms. Still a third of the 2.57M vertices that froze startup.
//
// Dropping a ring is not dropping a region: only a polygon whose OUTER ring goes
// is removed, and a region keeps every part still big enough to see.
