/*! Open Historia — in-game diagnostics log © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */
// The log a player can paste into a bug report.
//
// Before this, the only diagnostics the game could hand out were per-incident:
// the advisor's "Copy for a bug report" and the timeline's "Copy debugging
// message" (time.jsx), both of which describe ONE failed AI turn and nothing
// around it. That is the wrong shape for most reports, which are of the form
// "I loaded this save, queued these actions, jumped twice and the border went
// wrong" — a SEQUENCE. The packaged desktop app binds no developer tools (no
// F12, no menu entry), so the console those steps were already being written to
// was unreachable, and asking a player to reproduce a bug with DevTools open is
// asking most players for nothing.
//
// So: a rolling buffer of what happened, kept in memory, mirrored to
// localStorage so it survives the reload after a crash, and emitted as one
// plain-text report behind a Copy button and a Download button in
// Settings → Diagnostics.
//
// WHAT GOES IN. Two sources:
//   1. Explicit logDebugEvent() calls at the milestones a report needs — game
//      loaded/saved, turn started/finished/fell back, action queued, rollback,
//      provider changed, settings toggled.
//   2. Every console.warn / console.error the game already writes, plus
//      uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections, captured by
//      installDebugLogCapture(). The codebase logs its failures diligently
//      ("[actions] could not revert the unit order", "Failed to save actions")
//      and that is exactly the material a report needs, so it is collected
//      rather than duplicated by hand at every call site.
//
// WHAT NEVER GOES IN. API keys. Nothing here reads a key deliberately, but a
// key can arrive by accident inside a provider error, a URL or a stringified
// request, so redactSecrets() below is a second line of defence run over every
// entry as it is recorded — not at export time, so a key is never even held in
// the buffer. See that function for what it catches.
//
// Campaign text in the NORMAL log is kept short on purpose: titles, counts and
// ids, not event prose or chat bodies. A log a player is willing to paste in
// public is worth more than a complete one they are not. Detailed mode is the
// deliberate exception — see below.
//
// TWO SWITCHES, both in Settings → Diagnostics and both persisted in
// localStorage so they survive closing the app and switching campaigns:
//
//   * Logging (default ON). Off means nothing is recorded and the stored log is
//     thrown away. Checked at the top of logDebugEvent so a disabled log costs
//     the game nothing beyond a boolean test.
//   * Detailed logging (default OFF). Adds the entries marked `{ verbose: true }`
//     at their call sites — every AI task and API call rather than only the
//     failures, world-state changes turn by turn, panel navigation, console.log
//     chatter — and keeps far more of each one (longer details, deeper stacks).
//     It is off by default because it is heavier and quotes more of the
//     campaign, and on when a maintainer asks for it.
//
//     It also carries the full text of every conversation with the model: what
//     the player asked the advisor and what it answered, every diplomatic
//     message in both directions, and the notes a turn or the idle drip put in
//     the player's inbox. That is a deliberate choice, because the bugs people
//     actually report about the advisor and diplomacy — "it forgot what I told
//     it", "it replied as the wrong country", "it drafted a letter and sent
//     something else", "the block it sent never reached the board" — are all
//     about the CONTENT of an exchange, and a log recording only that an
//     exchange happened cannot settle any of them. Everything on this path is
//     campaign fiction the player wrote or the model wrote back; none of it is a
//     credential (redactSecrets still runs over it), but it is much more of
//     their campaign than the normal log quotes, and the Diagnostics panel says
//     so beside the switch.
//
// The buffer is bounded by SIZE, not only by entry count, and drops its oldest
// entries to stay there — see trimToBudget.

// Two ceilings, and the size one is the one that really governs.
//
// MAX_ENTRIES stops a quiet session growing without bound; MAX_LOG_CHARS is what
// keeps the log inside the storage it has to live in. Detailed mode raises both,
// because it now carries whole conversations: an advisor exchange is a question
// and a reply of a few thousand characters each, and a diplomatic round is one
// of those per country at the table. Against the normal 192 KB budget a single
// long consultation would evict the entire campaign that led up to it, which is
// the exact opposite of what a detailed log is for.
const MAX_ENTRIES = 400;
const MAX_ENTRIES_VERBOSE = 5000;
// localStorage is a ~5 MB budget shared with the translator cache, the flag
// library and every setting. The log is the least important thing in it, so the
// normal budget stays small; the detailed one takes a bigger share on the
// grounds that it is switched on deliberately, for one reproduction, by a player
// who has been asked for it. Both are characters, not bytes — Chromium stores
// them as UTF-16, so 1 MB here is ~2 MB of the quota, still well inside it.

// clipped raw model response or an advisor reply cut off mid-sentence is usually

// them. 20k is chosen to clear a long advisor answer (a few thousand characters,
// plus whatever fenced blocks it carries) whole.
const MAX_DETAIL_CHARS_VERBOSE = 20_000;

// instead of appending.
//
// Scanned over a WINDOW of recent entries rather than only the previous one,
// because storms interleave: maplibre's AJAXError and our own fetch rejection
// alternate, so consecutive-only matching would collapse neither. The time limit
