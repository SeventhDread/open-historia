    // restart on any build, and a copied or duplicated save keeps playing the
    // way it was set up. This key survives only as the default handed to a save
    // that has never chosen — which is what migrates every save made before the

// The beta unit system: a PER-SAVE setting.
//
// It lives in the active save's game.json, not in localStorage, for three
// reasons the old storage could not give:
//   * it survives a restart of any build — the desktop beta and the stable app
//     share their saves but NOT their Chromium profile (electron/main.cjs), so
//     a localStorage flag silently reset every time a tester swapped builds;
//   * two campaigns can run under different systems, which is the only way to
//     try the beta without converting a campaign you care about;
//   * copying or duplicating a save copies game.json with it, so the copy plays
//     the way the original did.
//
// Loading it is asynchronous (game.json is fetched), so mapSettings.js does not
// read it — runtime/library.js loads it whenever the active save changes and
// pushes it in here through applySaveBetaUnits(). Everything below is plain
// module state so this file stays importable without a DOM, a fetch or a save.

// What the loaded save says: true, false, or null for a save that has never
// chosen (every save written before the setting moved, and every new one).

// inherited the first time it is written to at all — the end of its first turn —
// and from then on it is independent. Flip the default while playing another
// campaign and this one is unaffected, which is the whole point of the setting
// being per save.
//
// Nothing is written merely to open a save: a game.json write bumps the save's

// the library menu because someone looked at a save is worse than waiting for

// a dozen call sites that must all agree about what the model was told, and a

// mid-turn switch, and the whole point of a per-save setting is that opening a
// beta campaign plays it under the beta rules. App.jsx keys the map and the UI
// on the active game id, so both remount around the new pin.
